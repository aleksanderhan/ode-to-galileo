Simplicio
Hello Salvati! I'm Simplicio, and I am really curious about the Delayed-choice quantum eraser. Can you explain it to me?
Salvati
Hello Simplicio! I'm glad to see your interest in such a fascinating and complex topic. The Delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment, first proposed by John Wheeler, is a variation of the famous double-slit experiment in quantum mechanics, which has profound implications for our understanding of reality and the nature of light.

In a simple double-slit experiment, a beam of light (or any other quantum particles like electrons) is directed at a barrier with two slits. When the light passes through the slits, it creates an interference pattern on a screen behind the barrier, as if the light behaved as a wave. However, if we place a detector at the slits to determine through which slit the light went, the interference pattern disappears, and we see two bands of light, as if the light behaved as a particle.

The Delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment adds a new twist. Instead of directly observing which path the light took, the experiment uses a setup that makes it possible to know or erase the which-path information after the light has already hit the screen. What's fascinating is that, even though the light has already hit the screen, whether or not we can see an interference pattern depends on whether the which-path information is available or has been 'erased', even if this decision is made after the light hits the screen.

This experiment suggests that the act of gaining information about the path of a quantum particle can retroactively change the particle's past behavior, which is a startling and counterintuitive outcome. However, it's important to note that this doesn't allow for faster-than-light communication or any kind of 'backwards in time' influence, due to a principle known as the 'no-signaling theorem'.

Simplicio
Thank you for the explanation, Salvati! This experiment seems quite mind-boggling. I'm trying to wrap my head around it, so please bear with me. If I understand correctly, in the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment, the decision to observe or erase the which-path information is made after the light has already hit the screen. But how exactly does this retroactively change the particle's past behavior? Can you provide an example or walk me through a hypothetical scenario?
Salvati
Absolutely, Simplicio, I'd be happy to walk you through a hypothetical scenario. It might make it easier to understand.

Let's imagine we have a variation of the double-slit experiment where we send individual photons (particles of light) towards the two slits. Each photon can go through one or both slits if we don't observe which path it takes. After passing through the slits, the photon hits a specific type of crystal that splits it into two entangled photons.

One of these photons (let's call it photon A) goes on to hit a screen that records where it lands. The other photon (photon B) takes a longer path and eventually hits a detector that can tell us which path the original photon took.

Now, here's where the 'delayed-choice' comes in. We can choose to set up the detector for photon B in one of two ways:

1) We could set up the detector to tell us definitively which path the original photon took (which slit it went through). If we do this, when we look at the screen where photon A landed, we see no interference pattern. The photons appear to have acted as particles, taking one path or the other.

2) Alternatively, we could set up the detector in a way that does not give us which-path information (by recombining the paths of photon B in a way that erases the which-path information). If we do this, when we look at the screen where photon A landed, we see an interference pattern. The photons appear to have acted as waves, passing through both slits.

What's bizarre is that photon A hits the screen before we make the decision about how to set up the detector for photon B. Yet, the pattern photon A creates on the screen seems to be dictated by the choice we make afterward. This appears to suggest that our later decision has somehow 'reached back in time' to influence the behaviour of photon A.

However, it's crucial to understand that this doesn't mean we can send information back in time. Due to the quantum randomness, we can't predict or control whether any individual photon creates an interference pattern or not. Additionally, to know whether an interference pattern is formed or not, we have to correlate the information from both photon A and photon B, which can't be done faster than the speed of light, respecting the 'no-signaling theorem'.

This experiment reveals the peculiar nature of quantum reality, where the behavior of quantum particles seems to be intrinsically linked to the information we have about them.
Simplicio
Wow, that is truly fascinating, Salvati! I'm starting to grasp the concept a bit better now. So, if I understand correctly, the behavior of photon A on the screen is dependent on whether we choose to observe or erase the which-path information of photon B. But how exactly does the choice we make for photon B affect photon A's behavior? Is there a specific mechanism or interaction between these entangled photons that causes this retroactive influence?
Salvati
That's a great question, Simplicio, and it gets to the heart of one of the most fascinating aspects of quantum physics. The behavior of photon A appears to be influenced by the choice we make for photon B due to a quantum phenomenon known as entanglement.

In quantum entanglement, two or more particles become linked and instantaneously affect each other's state no matter how far apart they are. This seems to defy our usual understanding of space and time, and even Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance."

In our hypothetical delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment, when the initial photon hits the crystal and splits into photons A and B, these two photons become entangled. This means that the state of photon A is instantaneously connected to the state of photon B.

When we choose to observe or erase the which-path information for photon B, we are choosing to either measure or not measure a property of photon B. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the act of measurement causes a quantum system to 'collapse' from a state of superposition (where it can be in multiple states at once) into a single definite state.

So when we measure which-path information for photon B, we force it (and thus also photon A, due to entanglement) to 'collapse' into a definite state of having gone through one slit or the other. This is why we see no interference pattern for photon A.

Conversely, when we erase the which-path information for photon B, we allow it (and thus also photon A) to remain in a superposed state of having gone through both slits. This is why we see an interference pattern for photon A.

It's important to note that this doesn't involve any kind of 'signal' being sent between the photons, nor does it allow for any kind of faster-than-light communication. It's simply a result of the strange and counterintuitive rules that govern the quantum world.
Simplicio
Thank you for explaining, Salvati! So, if I understand correctly, the entanglement between photon A and photon B is what allows the choice we make for photon B to retroactively influence the behavior of photon A. It's fascinating how the act of measurement can collapse the superposition and determine the outcome. 

But how does the entanglement between photon A and photon B actually occur? Is it a result of their initial interaction with the crystal, or is there another mechanism at play? And why does the entanglement allow for this retroactive influence, instead of just affecting the behavior of the photons simultaneously?
Salvati
You're right, Simplicio. The entanglement between photon A and photon B occurs as a result of their initial interaction with the crystal. Here's how it works:

When a single photon strikes the crystal, it is converted into a pair of new photons with lower energy, a process known as parametric down-conversion. The process conserves energy and momentum, which means the pair of new photons are correlated or entangled. 

The entanglement is a result of the conservation laws at play in this process. For instance, if the original photon had a certain amount of energy, the two new photons must carry that same amount of energy combined. Similarly, if the original photon had a certain momentum, the two new photons must have the same total momentum. These conservation laws lead to correlations between the properties of the two new photons, which is the essence of quantum entanglement.

As for your second question, why entanglement allows for what appears to be retroactive influence, it's a deep and subtle point about quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is fundamentally a theory of probabilities. Before we make a measurement, we can only say that there's a certain probability of finding a system in a given state. The act of measurement 'collapses' this probability into a definite outcome.

In the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment, the entangled photons A and B are in a superposition of states representing all possible outcomes. It's only when we make a measurement that this superposition 'collapses' to one definite outcome. If we choose to measure which-path information, we 'collapse' the superposition in a way that corresponds to no interference. On the other hand, if we erase the which-path information, we 'collapse' the superposition in a way that corresponds to an interference pattern.

This 'collapse' doesn't involve any real change in the physical state of the photons, nor does it involve any kind of signal being sent between them. Rather, it represents a change in our knowledge of the system. The 'retroactive' influence is not an actual influence traveling back in time, but rather a peculiar aspect of how our knowledge updates when we gain new information in a quantum world.
Simplicio
Thank you for explaining that, Salvati! It's fascinating how the conservation laws lead to the entanglement of photon A and photon B. I'm starting to get a better grasp on how this experiment works.

So, if I understand correctly, the act of measurement collapses the superposition of states into a definite outcome. But what exactly causes this collapse to happen? Is it something inherent to the nature of quantum particles, or is there another factor at play? And are there any theories or explanations for why measurement collapses the superposition in the way it does?
Salvati
You're asking some excellent questions, Simplicio. The act of measurement causing the collapse of the wavefunction, often called the 'measurement problem', is indeed one of the most fundamental and puzzling aspects of quantum mechanics.

In the traditional 'Copenhagen interpretation' of quantum mechanics, it's held that the act of measurement itself causes the wavefunction to collapse. That is, before measurement, a quantum system is in a superposition of states, and the act of measuring it forces the system into one of these states.

The exact mechanism of how this collapse occurs is not explained by the Copenhagen interpretation. In fact, it's often referred to as a 'miracle' in the sense that it doesn't follow from the Schrödinger equation, the fundamental equation that governs the evolution of quantum systems. The measurement is treated as an external process that is somehow fundamentally different from the usual physical processes described by quantum mechanics.

However, there are other interpretations of quantum mechanics that offer different perspectives on this problem. One of the most well known is the 'Many-Worlds Interpretation'. According to this interpretation, all possible outcomes of the quantum superposition continue to exist in a multiverse, but 'we' are only aware of one of these outcomes. This interpretation removes the need for a wavefunction collapse and instead, treats the process of measurement as a quantum interaction like any other.

Another interpretation is the 'decoherence' approach, which suggests that the interaction of a quantum system with its environment causes the superpositions of states to 'decohere' into distinct states, giving the appearance of a wavefunction collapse. 

None of these interpretations can be said to be definitively 'correct'. They all match our experimental observations, and choosing between them is largely a matter of philosophical preference. The question of why measurement collapses the wavefunction, and what 'measurement' really means, is still a topic of ongoing debate in the foundations of quantum mechanics.
Simplicio
Thank you for the detailed response, Salvati! The different interpretations of quantum mechanics definitely provide interesting perspectives on the measurement problem. It seems that there is still much to be understood and explored in this field.

I have another question regarding the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment. In the experiment, when we choose to erase the which-path information for photon B, we see an interference pattern for photon A. But how exactly does the act of erasing the information allow for the interference pattern to reappear? Is there a specific mechanism or process that enables this change in behavior?
Salvati
That's a great question, Simplicio! When we talk about 'erasing' the which-path information in the context of the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment, what we're really referring to is manipulating the setup in such a way that the which-path information of photon B is no longer discernible. 

This is usually achieved by adding a second beam splitter into the path of photon B. This beam splitter recombines the two possible paths of photon B, making it impossible to determine which path the photon took. 

When we do this, photon B can no longer be definitively associated with having gone through one slit or the other. As a result, photon A (which is entangled with photon B) also loses its association with a specific slit. This means that, as far as we can tell, photon A could have gone through either slit, which allows the possibility of interference.

In essence, erasing the which-path information 'restores' the wave-like behavior of the photons, allowing them to interfere with themselves and produce an interference pattern. This is because the photons are no longer 'forced' to act like particles that went through one slit or the other.

But remember, this doesn't mean that the photons 'decide' to change their behavior based on what we do. Rather, the behavior we observe (interference or no interference) is a result of the information we have about the system. If we have which-path information, we observe no interference. If we don't have which-path information, we observe interference. The act of erasing the which-path information simply changes the kind of information we have about the system.
Simplicio
I see, so by adding the second beam splitter and recombining the paths of photon B, we effectively make it impossible to determine which path the photon took. This, in turn, causes photon A to lose its association with a specific slit, allowing for the possibility of interference. 

It's interesting that it's the information we have about the system that determines the behavior we observe, rather than the photons themselves changing their behavior. It really highlights the role of observation and measurement in quantum mechanics.

I have another question, Salvati. In the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment, is it possible to predict or control whether an interference pattern will be observed for photon A, or is it purely random? And if it is random, what determines whether an interference pattern is formed or not?
Salvati
That's an insightful question, Simplicio. In the delayed-choice quantum eraser setup, whether or not an interference pattern is formed is not random in the traditional sense, but rather it is entirely dependent on the setup of the experiment and the information we choose to obtain.

As we discussed earlier, if we set up the experiment to retain which-path information by observing photon B, we will not see an interference pattern for photon A. Conversely, if we set up the experiment to erase the which-path information, we will see an interference pattern for photon A.

However, while the overall pattern can be controlled by the experimenter, the behavior of each individual photon is random and unpredictable. Quantum mechanics tells us only the probability that a photon will land at a particular place on the screen, not the exact place where any individual photon will land.

For example, if we erase the which-path information and allow for an interference pattern to form, quantum mechanics can tell us that a photon is more likely to land in the bright fringes of the pattern and less likely to land in the dark fringes. But it can't tell us exactly where within those fringes a particular photon will land. This individual randomness is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics.

So, in summary, while we can control whether or not an overall interference pattern forms by choosing what information to measure, the exact behavior of each individual photon within that pattern is fundamentally random and unpredictable.
Simplicio
Thank you for the clarification, Salvati! It's intriguing how the behavior of each individual photon is random, while the overall pattern can be controlled by the setup of the experiment and the information we choose to obtain. It seems like quantum mechanics is full of fascinating and counterintuitive aspects.

I have another question related to the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment. When we choose to observe the which-path information for photon B, causing the interference pattern to disappear for photon A, does this mean that the wave-like behavior of the photons is completely lost? Or is there still some lingering wave-like behavior, even though we see no interference?
Salvati
That's an excellent question, Simplicio! When we measure the which-path information for photon B, the interference pattern for photon A indeed disappears. This happens because the act of measurement forces the photons to 'choose' a definite path, which is a particle-like behavior. 

However, this does not mean that the wave-like behavior of the photons is completely lost. Instead, it's more accurate to say that the wave-like behavior is 'hidden' or 'suppressed' by the act of measurement. 

In quantum mechanics, particles like photons are described by wavefunctions, mathematical functions that give the probability of finding the particle in different states. Even when we measure a particle and find it in a definite state, it is still described by a wavefunction - it's just that the wavefunction is now 'collapsed' to a state that corresponds to the measurement outcome.

So, in the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment, even when we measure the which-path information and see no interference, the photons are still described by wavefunctions. They still have wave-like properties, but these properties are not manifest in the experiment's outcome because the measurement forces the photons to behave like particles.

It's one of the core principles of quantum mechanics that particles like photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, depending on how we measure them. This is often referred to as wave-particle duality. The delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment is a brilliant demonstration of this principle, showing how our choice of measurement can bring out either the wave-like or particle-like behavior of light.
Simplicio
Thank you for the explanation, Salvati! It's fascinating to think that even when we measure the which-path information and see no interference, the photons still retain their wave-like properties, just in a "hidden" or "suppressed" form. It really highlights the duality of particles in quantum mechanics.

I have another question related to the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment. In the experiment, when we choose to erase the which-path information, allowing for the interference pattern to reappear, does this mean that the photons behave as if they have traveled through both slits simultaneously? And if so, how can a single photon go through both slits at the same time?
Salvati
That's a great question, Simplicio, and it touches upon one of the most fascinating aspects of quantum mechanics. Yes, when we erase the which-path information, it's as if each photon has passed through both slits simultaneously. This is due to the principle of superposition in quantum mechanics.

The principle of superposition states that a quantum system can exist in multiple states or places at the same time, as long as we don't measure it. In the context of the double-slit experiment, until we observe which path the photon takes, it exists in a superposition of states—meaning it can be considered to have traveled through both slits at the same time. 

When this superposition comes into contact with itself (interferes), it produces the interference pattern we observe. This 'wave-like' behavior is characteristic of systems in superposition. 

However, when we measure which path the photon takes (the which-path information), we force the photon to 'choose' a single path, thus breaking the superposition. This is when we observe 'particle-like' behavior.

It's important to note that these aren't behaviors in the classical sense—photons don't 'decide' to act like waves or particles. Instead, these are different ways the underlying quantum reality can manifest itself, depending on how we interact with it. The delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment is brilliant because it shows this interplay between knowledge, measurement, and the behavior of quantum systems.
